                            Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions. Small minds will always do
                            that, but great minds will give you a feeling that you can become great too.

                            Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made

                        Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct
                        individual
                        accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to
                        attain
                        uncommon results. Individual commitment to a group effortâ€”that is what makes a team work, a
                        company
                        work, a society work, a civilisation work.
